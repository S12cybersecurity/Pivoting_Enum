# Pivoting Enumearion
**Automate All Pivoting System Enumeration with this Bash Script**

**How Works?**

This Script works in a very simple but at the same time very effective way. These are the steps it executes:

**1- Basic Information**

This module of script only show you the IP's from the Machine, and with "which" command check the utilities are available in your System

**2- Network Recon**

Basically what this module does is via the ping command and a one-second timer checks the active hosts in the subnet that you have indicated, it is very basic but it never fails.

The second and last part of this module is port scanning, it takes the active hosts found in the previous part of the module, and looks at their open ports.
